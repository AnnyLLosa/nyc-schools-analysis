Practitioner's Final Insight

   "My analysis reveals the transition to an Inner Join strategy has allowed for a high-integrity analysis of the Manhattan borough.
While Brooklyn and the Bronx represent the largest logistical challenges due to school volume (121 and 118 schools respectively), 
Manhattan stands out as a critical area for demographic-specific funding. With a verified 7.57% ELL average and flagship inclusive 
schools like East Side Community School, Manhattan serves as a model for specialized resource distribution."
